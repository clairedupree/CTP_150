Use the same file as Assignment 1 but without the averages.
Develop a class named Football that stores Football players above in an array of Strings.

Develop a client to test the Football class. 
The client should be menu driven, presenting a list of options to the end user, retrieving the user’s request, and processing that request.
The menu should be displayed after each query. The program should continue until the end user indicates to terminate.  

Example run of the Lab5 class:

Main Menu
1 - Show all players - ascending order
2 - Show all players - descending order
3 - Search a rank - Must be from 1-10
4 - Search for a football player:  Print the player or error message
5 - Exit
