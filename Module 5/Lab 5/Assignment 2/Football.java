-- CLASS DEFINITION --

Use the same file above but without the averages:  here Download here

Develop a class named Football that stores Football players above in an array of Strings.
The first player is ranked number 1 and Aaron Rogers is ranked number 10  Hence, the array must accommodate 10.
The class constructor should read the FootballNames.txt file, storing each record read into an element of the array.  

The Football class defines methods to support queries of the array.  The following methods should be defined:
displayPlayers():  Displays all Players ranked 1 through 10.  The rank and name should be displayed for all data items.
displayPlayersReverse():  Displays all Players ranked 10 through 1.  The rank and name should be displayed for all data items.
displayWinnersByNumber():  Displays all Football players by number of rank.  The rank and name should be displayed for all data items.
I type in a rank from 1 - 10 and display that player's name and rank. 
findPlayers():  Searches the array for all occurrences of the ball club name given as a parameter.
The method displays the rank and name of the player and  an appropriate message when not found. I type in Lamar Jackson.
Is his name in the file?

Exit(): Says goodbye
Include a menu that will have these  options and choose one and run the program.
