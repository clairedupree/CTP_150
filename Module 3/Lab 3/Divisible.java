/**
   Read a file that shows an upper bound on each record.
   
   1. Write a program that reads a record in the file and 
   2. Shows integers in a range from 1 to that number (inclusive)that are divisible by 2
   3. Show the sum of those integers
   4. Show the number of integers not divisible by 2
   5. Show the sum of those integers
   6. Repeat all of the above, divisible by 3
   7. Repeat for every line of the file.
   
   * Sample output: *
   
      The following results are based on the the first record in the file which is:  10
         There are 5 numbers divisible by 2. The sum of the numbers divisible by 2 is 30.  Those numbers are 2 4 6 8 10
         There are 5 numbers not divisible by 2. The sum of the numbers not divisible by 2 is 25.  Those numbers are 1 3 5 7 9 
         
         The following results are based on the the first record in the file which is:  10
         There are 3 numbers divisible by 3. The sum of the numbers divisible by 3 is 18.  Those numbers are 3,6, 9.
         There are 7 numbers not divisible by 3. The sum of the numbers not divisible by 3 is 37.  Those numbers are 1 2 4 5 7 8 10
         
   // Probably nested loops      
   // TODO: introduce program.
   // TODO: would you like to read the next record in the file?
   // TODO: You have reached the end of the file.
    
   Read the next record and do the same thing as above
